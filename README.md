# Sistem-Online-Banking
Made based on the final project of the Algorithm and Programming course.

It's a toy code, so nothing special about it. Made it for learning C syntax.
I made it based on the algorithm of the mobile banking app.

When you withdraw, it's gonna generate a token for you to input it on an ATM. Just like how mobile banking apps work.
So does when you make a transaction for an electric bill which use token.
The data when you first time starts the program doesn't disappear when you exit the program just how like common ATM or banking toy program does.
So you can use it without inserting your name repeatedly. But still, you must insert your phone number and password tho.

Fitures in program:
1. "Landing Page": a. Register, b. Login, c. Forgot Password
2. Main Menu: a. Check Balance, b. Deposit, c. Online Withdraw, d. Online Payment, e. Change Password, f. Struct
